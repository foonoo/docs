# Writing with Foonoo
Before foonoo converts any text files into the expected output (html pages, for now,) it's pre-processesed to extract foonoo specific tags. These tags make it easier to perform certain tasks like easily linking between foonoo pages or embedding media into pages. Additionally, third party plugins and extensions to foonoo ave the ability to introduce their own tags to enrich the writing process within foonoo.
