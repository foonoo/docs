# Building Sites

Foonoo's default site generator provides a unique way of combining templates and text files, and in some cases data to generate sites. For most parts, the default site generator is heavily dependent on the themes to provide a lot of the features that tie sites together. In this section, we will take a look at how the default site generator can be used, and we will look at how the default theme that ships with foonoo allows us to build even more complex sites.

## The Default Generator and Theming
Sites in foonoo always have themes enabled when being generated. When simply rendering text files, the default site generator and its default themes are used. The default theme that ships with the default site generator is highly configurable. And you always have the opportunity to use your own themes.

When generating simple sites where you are only rendering Markdown files, the default theme simply wraps the processed HTML output of the text file with an HTML wrapper that provides a stylesheet to decorate the text. Beyond this blank default, this theme can be configured to provide title bars, navigation blocks, and even special colour schemes.

## Defining your own Templates
Templating for foonoo is provided by the honam template engine that ships with the ntentan framework. Honam provides a hierarichal template resolution system whereby a given hierarchy of paths is searched in a given order when looking for templates to render HTML files.

The template hierarchy for resolving any foonoo templates is as follows, in increasing order of priority:

- Templates in the `_foonoo/templates` directory. Templates here can be supplied by the person building the site, and the carry the highest priority to override any other templates.
- Template paths specified in the `templates` configuration of the `site.yml` file.
- Templates from the current active theme. Templates here are supplied by the theme creator.
- Built in templates for tag parser. The templates here are into foonoo and they are meant to provide meaningful defaults for content generated by the tag parser (for things like links and images).
